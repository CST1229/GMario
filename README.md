## Specifications ##

This engine was made with _Game Maker Studio 1.4.99999._  
GM Legacy (GM8.1 and below) will **NOT** work.  
GMS2 _may_ work, but may need to be fixed up to function completely.  
The help.rtf in the project folder is the help that would show up when you press F1 ingame. GMS saves all projects with this file. It's empty, so it doesn't show up when you do press F1.  
I will probably not keep developing this, because i don't know what to do next. It's up to the community to make forks and/or keep it alive.
